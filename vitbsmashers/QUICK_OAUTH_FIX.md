# âš¡ QUICK OAuth Fix - Add Test User

## ðŸš¨ **Current Issue:**
```
TokenError: You can't sign in to this app because it doesn't comply with Google's OAuth 2.0 policy for keeping apps secure.
```

## âœ… **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:**

Your OAuth app is in **testing mode**. You need to add yourself as a test user.

### **Step 1: Go to Google Cloud Console**
1. Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Select your project
3. Go to **APIs & Services** â†’ **OAuth consent screen**

### **Step 2: Add Test User**
1. Scroll down to **Test users** section
2. Click **+ ADD USERS**
3. Enter your email address (the one you're trying to sign in with)
4. Click **SAVE**

### **Step 3: Wait & Test**
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for changes to take effect
2. Try signing in again at: https://vitbsmashers.onrender.com
3. Should work now! âœ…

## ðŸ“‹ **What I Fixed:**
- âœ… Removed domain restrictions from OAuth config
- âœ… Deployed changes to Render (auto-deploy triggered)
- âœ… Created this quick fix guide

## ðŸŽ¯ **Next Steps:**
1. **Add yourself as test user** (above)
2. **Test OAuth login**
3. **Continue developing other features**
4. **Later:** Publish app for production (see `OAUTH_PRODUCTION_SETUP.md`)

**That's it! Your OAuth should work normally now.**
